# v1.4.0 — Production Provider Platform

> **Audience:** product, architecture, engineering, security, operations, documentation, release, and AI coding agents
> **Owner:** Provider Platform Maintainers

## Contract Rules

- Preserve `forgevena`, `ai-workspace`, `.ai-workspace/`, structured envelopes, preview-first mutation, and explicit external consent.
- Add interfaces only through versioned schemas and shared domain services.
- Document authentication references, permissions, rate limits, pagination, errors, idempotency, cancellation, and compatibility.
- Never place credentials or sensitive content in arguments, URLs, logs, state, diagnostics, or evidence.

## Surface Impact

- Version provider adapter, compatibility manifest, and normalized error schemas.
- Extend provider CLI and dashboard through shared domain services without changing existing command names.

## Compatibility

Backward compatibility is required throughout 1.x. Later breaking changes require deprecation, migration preview, compatibility reports, rollback, and support for the final prior-major release.
